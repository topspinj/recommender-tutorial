    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will build an implicit feedback recommender system using the [implicit](https://github.com/benfred/implicit) package.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is implicit feedback, exactly? Let's revisit collaborative filtering. In [Part 1](https://github.com/topspinj/recommender-tutorial/blob/master/part-1-item-item-recommender.ipynb), we learned that [collaborative filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) is based on the assumption that `similar users like similar things`. The user-item matrix, or \"utility matrix\", is the foundation of collaborative filtering. In the utility matrix, rows represent users and columns represent items. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/utility-matrix.png\" width=\"30%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The cells of the matrix are populated by a given user's degree of preference towards an item, which can come in the form of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **explicit feedback:** direct feedback towards an item (e.g., movie ratings which we explored in [Part 1](https://github.com/topspinj/recommender-tutorial/blob/master/part-1-item-item-recommender.ipynb))\n",
    "2. **implicit feedback:** indirect behaviour towards an item (e.g., purchase history, browsing history, search behaviour)\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit feedback makes assumptions about a user's preference based on their actions towards items. Let's take Netflix for example. If you binge-watch a show and blaze through all seasons in a week, there's a high chance that you like that show. However, if you start watching a series and stop halfway through the first episode, there's suspicion to believe that you probably don't like that show. \n",

These latent features give a more compact representation of user tastes and item descriptions. Matrix factorization is particularly useful for very sparse data and can enhance the quality of recommendations. The algorithm works by factorizing the original user-item matrix into two factor matrices:\n",
